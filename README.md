Class: ECE 287 - Digital System Design

Topic: Tic-Tac-Toe with a 2 Player mode & versus AI (3 modes: easy,medium,hard)

Description Of Topic: 

The purpose of this project is to use the FPGA board to project a playable tic-tac-toe game onto a screen using the VGA. The user can play versus another by them both flipping switches on the FPGA board to declare a move. ALso, the user can play against an AI bot of hard, medium, or easy difficulty by pressing one of the buttons.


Background Information:

The idea of tic-tac-toe is very popular and we are sure that everyone knows the basic concepts on how to play the game. The tic-tac-toe algorithm that we implemented, as explained here, takes in a user input by flipping one of the first nine switches and project a X to a position on the displayed board. Then depending on what mode you would like to do play if you would like to play against another user, the second user would then represent O's and take control of the second nine switches. However, if the user would like to play against An AI they would select the 2nd button for the hard difficulty, the 3rd button for medium difficulty, and the 4th button for easy difficulty. Finally once a winner is detected in whatever style you decide to play, you must press the reset button, which is button 1 to restart the game. There is 8 different possible winning combinations to end the game.
